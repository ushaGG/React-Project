        text=" Built by Chamaraja Wodeyar in the year 1887, Bangalore Palace is an inspired design by Englandâ€™s Windsor Castle and is one of the best tourist places in Bangalore. The evocative palace comprises fortified arches, towers, Tudor-style architecture, and green lawns along with sophisticated wood carvings in the interior. It is where the royal family still resides at the present. This Tudor-style architectural creation is nothing less than an epitome. The palace has earned foundations that have been attributed to the Wodeyars of Mysore."
